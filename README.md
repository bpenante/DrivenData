In this file we work on the challenge aimed at predicting how many individuals will donate blood in the near future at a university campus.
There is a vehicle that goes to the university campus once every three months, and we have access to data for the individuals who have given blood in the past. The data consists of how long is has been since someone donated, how many times the person has donated blood, if he/she donated the previous time the vehicle came by, etc. Our task is to predict if the person will donate blood next time the vehicle comes or not. This is thus a binary classification problem. I am using this challenge to learn how to implement various machine learning methods I am studying at the moment using Python and the numpy, pandas and sklearn libraries. I haven't submitted it yet as I would like to increase the accuracy of my model first.
